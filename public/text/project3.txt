 Project Name: Real-time Chat Application

 Summary:
This project was about building a real-time chat application using Node.js and Socket.io. The aim was to implement a platform where users could communicate instantly with each other.
 Description:
In this project, I built a chat application where multiple users could join a chat room and exchange messages in real-time. The project leveraged WebSockets through Socket.io to maintain an open connection between clients and the server.

Key features included:
- Real-time communication with no noticeable delay.
- User notifications when new users join or leave the chat.
- Message broadcasting to all connected users.
- A simple yet intuitive user interface built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
