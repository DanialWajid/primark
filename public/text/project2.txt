 Project Name: Online Bookstore

 Summary:
The Online Bookstore project was designed as a web application that allows users to browse, search, and purchase books online. It focused on implementing CRUD operations using PHP and MySQL.

 Description:
This project was an introduction to full-stack web development. The application allowed users to create an account, search for books, add items to a cart, and purchase them. The back-end was developed in PHP, with MySQL handling the database for book information and user accounts.

Key features included:
- User authentication (login and registration).
- Cart functionality where users could add and remove books.
- Dynamic price calculation and order summaries.
- Integration of AJAX for seamless cart updates without page reloads.
